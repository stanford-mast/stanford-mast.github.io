The RAMP project's goal is to enable the intensive, multidisciplinary innovation that the computing industry will need to tackle the problems of parallel processing. RAMP itself is an open-source, community-developed, FPGA-based emulator of parallel architectures. its design framework lets a large, collaborative community develop and contribute reusable, composable design modules. three complete designs - for transactional memory, distributed systems, and distributed-shared memory - demonstrate the platform's potential.
