The DRAM-Based Reconfigurable Acceleration Fabric (DRAF) uses commodity DRAM technology to implement a bit-level, reconfigurable fabric that improves area density by 10 times and power consumption by more than 3 times over conventional field-programmable gate arrays. Latency overlapping and multicontext support allow DRAF to meet the performance and density requirements of demanding applications in data center and mobile environments.
