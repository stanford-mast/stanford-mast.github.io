In our VLDB 2022 publication (Skiadopoulos, 2022), we presented the rationale for a DBMS-oriented operating system and reported a series of experiments supporting this approach. This paper provides a comprehensive update on the project, which evolved as a research initiative for two additional years before transitioning into a venture-capital-backed startup over the past 18 months. During this period, we developed a provenance system and a programming environment integrating Python and TypeScript, accompanied by detailed performance evaluations. Furthermore, we outline the modifications made to the research prototype to support the demands of commercialization.
