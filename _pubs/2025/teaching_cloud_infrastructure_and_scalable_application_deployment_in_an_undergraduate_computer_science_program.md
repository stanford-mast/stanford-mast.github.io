Making successful use of cloud computing requires nuanced approaches to both system design and deployment methodology, involving reasoning about the elasticity, cost, and security models of cloud services. Building cloud-native applications without a firm understanding of the fundamentals of cloud engineering can leave students susceptible to cost and security pitfalls. Yet, cloud computing is not commonly taught at the undergraduate level. To address this gap, we designed an undergraduate-level course that frames cloud infrastructure deployment as a software engineering practice. Our course featured a number of hands-on assignments that gave students experience with modern, best-practice concepts and tools including infrastructure-as-code (IaC). We describe the design of the course, our experience teaching its initial offering, and provide our reflections on what worked well and potential areas for …
