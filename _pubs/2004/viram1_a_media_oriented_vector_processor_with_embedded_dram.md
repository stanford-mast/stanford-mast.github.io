Processors for mobile multimedia devices must be low power while having excellent performance on media applications. Our processor, VIRAM1, accomplishes this by combining vector processing with embedded DRAM. VIRAM1 includes a scalar core, 13 megabytes (104 megabits) of DRAM, and four vector datapaths. It consumes 2 watts at 200 MHz and executes up to 9.6 giga-ops (16 bit) per second.
