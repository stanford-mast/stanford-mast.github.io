Plasticine is a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of high-level parallel patterns. With an area footprint of 113 mm2 in a 28-nm process and a 1-GHz clock, Plasticine has a peak floating-point performance of 12.3 single-precision Tflops and a total on-chip memory capacity of 16 MB, consuming a maximum power of 49 W. Plasticine provides an improvement of up to 76.9X in performance-per-watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range of dense and sparse applications.
