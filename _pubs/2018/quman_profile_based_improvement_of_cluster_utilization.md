Modern data centers consolidate workloads to increase server utilization and reduce total cost of ownership, and cope with scaling limitations. However, server resource sharing introduces performance interference across applications and, consequently, increases performance volatility, which negatively affects user experience. Thus, a challenging problem is to increase server utilization while maintaining application QoS.In this article, we presentQuMan, a server resource manager that uses application isolation and profiling to increase server utilization while controlling degradation of application QoS. Previous solutions, either estimate interference across applications and then restrict colocation to “compatible” applications, or assume that application requirements are known. Instead,QuManestimates the required resources of applications. It uses an isolation mechanism to create properly-sized resource slices …
