At WARFP 2005, we proposed ATLAS as a scalable implementation for transactional parallel systems [5]. The impetus for the development of ATLAS is to address the significant hurdles that software simulators face in multiprocessor architectural research. In particular, ATLAS is an FPGA-based system that primarily serves as a rapid software development platform for our transactional memory model, TCC [4]. Leveraging commodity hardware and software tools, ATLAS is poised to support research exploring the impact of transactional memory on architecture, operating systems, compilers and programming models.To date, we have implemented a fully functional 2-processor ATLAS system on Xilinxâ€™s XUP board [8], employing the two embedded PowerPC cores in the Virtex II Pro FPGA. To interface with the TCC caches in the FPGA fabric, we have also implemented the TCC API [3]. Additionally, we have developed infrastructure to support debugging and profiling with the aim of increasing visibility and ease of performance tuning of applications.
