Transactional memory systems apply the experience of the database community to the general problem of parallel programming with the goal of providing a simple parallel programing model that delivers on the performance potential of multi-processor systems. Although initial research into both software-only and hardwaresupported transactional memory has shown promising results, there are many challenges to creating a fully transactional software stack. Although todayâ€™s software stack has some limited use of transactional programming, many parts of the stack from basic data structures to the operating system and program runtimes contain at least some lock-based code. In code with coarse-grained locking, transactions provide an opportunity to improve performance. In code with fine-grained lock, transactions provide an opportunity to simplify code while reducing overhead.
